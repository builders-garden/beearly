# Beearly 🐝

This is the repository containing the code of the Beearly waitlist creation app.

## Overview

With Beearly you can create your personal and customised waitlist, share it throught a convenient Farcaster Frame generated by Beearly itself and thus advertise a new product you're launching, an airdrop you want to make or even kickstart a new community!\
There is no limit on the purpose of your waitlist. Just don't worry and Beearly!

## Eligibility requirements

During the waitlist creation, you are able to select some eligibility requirements you want people to meet in order to join.\
Those requirements are pretty useful to limit bots from joining or even to create a very exclusive waitlist!

The requirements you cat set are:

- Solve a simple captcha step before joining
- Follow specific Farcaster channels
- Follow specific Farcaster users
- Have a minimum [Builder Score](https://talentprotocol.notion.site/Builder-Score-FAQ-4e07c8df13514ce79661ed0d776d4741) (powered by Talent Protocol)
- Have a Farcaster Power Badge

## Waitlist management

Through the Beearly web app you can manage every waitlist you created and check users that already joined them, having a simple and useful overview of their information like: their followers, if they have a Farcaster Power Badge or not, their [Airstack social score](https://docs.airstack.xyz/airstack-docs-and-faqs/farcaster/farcaster/social-capital) and more!

From the management page you can also:

- Modify the joining requirements
- Customise the joining frame images
- Test the waitlist's frame before sharing it
- Find the frame and the leaderboard's URLs
- Broadcast Farcaster direct casts to your users
- Manually add users to your waitlist
- Export the whole list of users in a convienient .csv file

## Leaderboard

Every waitlist has a leaderboard associated.\
The leaderboard lets you see all the users that shared your frame on Farcaster and also how many people joined your waitlist thanks to them.\
Maybe you can plan an airdrop or mint an NFT for the most industrious ones, who knows?

Again, feel free to choose the purpose of this leaderboard!

## Tiers and pricing

Currently Beearly supports in-app USDC payments over the [Base](https://www.base.org/) Ethereum Layer 2.\
Buying a tier unlocks the possibility to create exactly one (1) waitlist with that tier.
