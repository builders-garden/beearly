# 🐝 Beearly

This repository contains the source code for the **Beearly** waitlist creation web app.

<img src="./public/beearly-logo.svg">

## 📋 Features

The app is a factory that allows users to create waitlists, to let their followers participate in the launch of new projects and products or even to kick start a brand new community.
Users can also set deadlines for their waitlists or establish special requirements for joining.

People can enter a user's waitlist with just one click by interacting with a tailor-made Farcaster Frame, whose url link is automatically generated by **beearly**.

Inside the app the user can manage his waitlists and check their current state, give updates to whitelisted people by sending them direct casts and even see a leaderboard with people that put high effort in sharing the waitlist by their own.
